What is a Database Management System (DBMS)?	A DBMS is system software for creating and managing databases, providing a systematic way to create, retrieve, update, and manage data.
What are the three key components managed by a DBMS?	1. Data, 2. Database engine (access, lock, modify data), 3. Database schema (logical structure).
What is the purpose of the DBMS architecture?	It determines the design of the DBMS, which can be centralized, decentralized, or hierarchical. It features three layers: database, DBMS, and view layers.
What are the components of the DBMS layer?	1. Query Processor: DML Pre-compiler, Embedded DML Pre-compiler, DDL Interpreter, Query Evaluation Engine. 2. Storage Manager: Authorization and Integrity Manager, Transaction Manager, File Manager, Buffer Manager.
What is the role of the Query Processor in a DBMS?	It translates, compiles, and executes queries to interact with the database efficiently.
What does the Storage Manager in a DBMS do?	It handles storing, retrieving, and updating data, managing integrity, transactions, file allocation, and memory caching.
What is a Data Dictionary in a DBMS?	A file or set of files containing metadata, such as data ownership, relationships, and structure.
What is indexing in DBMS?	A data structure technique to retrieve records efficiently based on key attributes.
What are the levels of data abstraction in DBMS?	1. Physical Level (storage structure, compression), 2. Conceptual Level (structure for users, schema), 3. External Level (user view).
What are the types of data models in DBMS?	Relational, Network, Hierarchical, Object-Oriented, Context, Object-Relational, Entity-Relationship, Semi-Structured, Associative, Record-Based, Flat models.

What is the role of the File Manager in a DBMS?	It manages disk storage allocation and the data structures for storing database information.
What does the Buffer Manager do?	It decides which data to cache in main memory to optimize database performance.
What is a 'tuple' in the Relational Data Model?	A single row in a relational table that represents a unique record.
What is an 'attribute' in the Relational Data Model?	A column in a relational table representing a specific type of data for all tuples.
What are the components of the Database Layer?	1. Data Dictionary, 2. Data Files, 3. DBMS Indexing.
What are the three types of DBMS architectures?	1. Centralized, 2. Decentralized, 3. Hierarchical.
What is a Physical Level in DBMS?	Describes how data is physically stored, retrieved, compressed, and encrypted in a database.
What is the Conceptual Level in DBMS?	Describes the structure of the entire database, including entities and their relationships.
What is the External Level in DBMS?	Describes how individual end-users view the data, providing the closest interaction with users.
What is a data model in DBMS?	An abstract model that organizes and standardizes data relationships and structures.
What is normalization in the Relational Data Model?	A process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity.
What is the advantage of the Object-Oriented Data Model?	It allows for the storage of complex data types, like multimedia files, with methods and attributes.
What are the key disadvantages of the Network Data Model?	System complexity, navigational data access, and difficulty in structural modifications.
What is the main focus of the Entity-Relationship (ER) Model?	Modeling entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them for database design.
What is the main advantage of the Semi-Structured Data Model?	Flexibility in data structure and improved integration for big data analytics.
What is the purpose of a Data Dictionary?	To store metadata about database structure, ownership, and relationships.
What is the significance of DBMS Indexing?	It improves data retrieval efficiency by using data structures for quick lookups.
What is the Object-Relational Data Model?	A combination of Object-Oriented and Relational models that supports inheritance and complex data structures.
What is the Associative Model in DBMS?	Focuses on dividing data into entities and associations for efficient data relationships.
What is the Flat Data Model?	An early model where all data is stored in a single table, making it inefficient for large datasets.
What are the disadvantages of the Object-Oriented Data Model?	Complex data and relationships can make it difficult to manage.
What are the key characteristics of the Network Data Model?	Organized graphically with multiple paths to access entities.
What is the difference between the Conceptual and External Levels?	The Conceptual Level is for groups of users, while the External Level is tailored for individual users.
What is a hierarchical relationship in a Hierarchical Model?	One-to-many relationships where one parent entity can have multiple child entities.
What is the key challenge with the Hierarchical Data Model?	Programming complexity due to dependence on physical paths for data retrieval.
What are Semi-Structured Data Models best suited for?	Big data, unstructured data integration, and analytics.
What is the purpose of the Query Evaluation Engine?	To execute low-level instructions generated by the Query Processor.
What is the role of the Authorization and Integrity Manager in DBMS?	To enforce user access permissions and ensure integrity constraints are met.
What is the significance of the Transaction Manager in DBMS?	It ensures atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties) of transactions.

What are the two types of data independence in DBMS?	1. Logical data independence, 2. Physical data independence.

What is the External Schema in DBMS?	A customized view of the data tailored to individual end-users.
How does the Network Data Model handle relationships?	By representing them as edges in a graph, allowing many-to-many relationships.
What is a Foreign Key in the Relational Data Model?	An attribute in one table that references the Primary Key in another table to establish relationships.
What is the difference between a Primary Key and a Candidate Key?	A Primary Key uniquely identifies records, while a Candidate Key is a potential Primary Key.
What is the significance of the View Layer in DBMS architecture?	It provides user-specific views and hides the complexity of the underlying database.
What is a Weak Entity in the Entity-Relationship Model?	An entity that cannot be uniquely identified by its attributes and requires a related strong entity.
What is the difference between Static and Dynamic Data Models?	Static models define fixed structures, while dynamic models can adapt to changes over time.
What are the limitations of the Flat Data Model?	Inefficient for large datasets, lacks relationships between records, and poor scalability.
What is the purpose of Normal Forms in DBMS?	To eliminate redundancy and ensure data dependencies are logical and efficient.

What is 2NF (Second Normal Form)?	A table in 1NF where all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the Primary Key.
What is 3NF (Third Normal Form)?	A table in 2NF where all attributes are not only dependent on the Primary Key but also free of transitive dependency.
What is BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)?	A stricter version of 3NF where every determinant is a candidate key.

What is a Join Operation in Relational Algebra?	Combines two relations based on a common attribute to create a new relation.
What is the difference between Inner Join and Outer Join?	Inner Join returns matching records, while Outer Join includes unmatched records as well.
